# Write some short but thoughtful comments about each of the following:

### Regarding the estimates that you did for practical tasks, how was your accuracy and did your accuracy improve during the course of the subject?
My initial estimates were not accurate. As we go through many 
different practicals, the accuracy improved and so did my time to finish each question.

### Regarding code reviews, what have you learned from both being reviewed and doing reviews?
Being reviewed is great as people may catch mistakes sometimes easily 
overlooked by ourselves. Reviewing other people's code helps us to 
improve our coding techniques used by them and also help other spot their mistakes.

### Regarding the practical tasks overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
Overall, I say the method used to teach this subject was great and helpful. Can't think of
other reasons to change this subject's teaching method.

### Include proper Markdown links to two (2) PRs that show you doing good code reviews for any of the past pracs.
